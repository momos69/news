I fetched the API data from NewsAPI and displayed the top headlines using the fetch function in React/JSX. To enhance code quality, I divided the webpage into multiple components, allowing for component reusability. Additionally, I implemented error handling. In the event of a webpage failure due to an API error, an error page will be displayed, which is itself a React component located within the component folder.</p>
